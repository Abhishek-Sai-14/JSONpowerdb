2. A proprietary algorithm for CRUD operations with high performance. Several times quicker than well-known DBMS.
3. Serverless support for quicker development - A complete dynamic application may be developed by a UI developer.
4. The speed of DBMS with integrated web / application server and embedded cache is lightning fast.
5. The best query performance is provided by server side Native NoSQL.
6. Built-in ability to query across many JPDB databases.
7. Support for Document DB, Key-Value DB, and RDBMS in a multi-mode DBMS.
8. Easy to develop and maintain and without a schema.
9. HTTP-compatible programming languages can use the web-services API.
10. Improved with a framework that supports pluggable APIs - A developer can create a pluggable API and add it to any of our cloud JPDB instances.
11. The development process is made simple, more readable, and less error prone through the standardisation of API development framework.
12. Multiple levels of security.
